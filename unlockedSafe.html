    <h1>Sine The Sleuth</h1>

    <p>7463... I believe that sequence spells out “SINE” on a key pad. And I was able to use Law of Sines to complete that problem... whoever owns this safe must know me well.

<br><br>I insert the code and hear the Metallic door unlatch. It swings open revealing a small number of items inside. An empty box of 2π (it must have been stolen from the kitchen!) and a photo of Cotangent with the letters “YOU WILL BE UNDEFINED” scribbled across its surface in red ink. These items must bel

<br><br>I find a nearby plastic bag and carefully slide the safe’s contents into it as to not risk contaminating the evidence. I rush up the basement stairs and down the hall towards the dining.

<br><br>I look around me and am pleased to see Cosecant resting at the dining room table with Dr. Hipparchus by his side. He must be feeling better.

<br><br>Cosine approaches eagerly.

<br><br>“Sine! I’ve got it,” he says with an odd tone of excitement. He continues in a whisper: “It must be our mother. She must be guilty. She could handle the poison without issue because Tan of 2π is 0; It would have no effect on her. She is the perfect subject!”

<br><br>A pause for a moment. Dread fills lungs.

<br><br>“Cosecant...” I pause, “I... I never said anything about the poison.”

<br><br>Everyone in the room hears the concern in my voice and turns their heads.

<br><br>“Neither did I...” Secant says.

<br><br>“None of us did.” Cosecant says weakly.

<br><br>Everything is beginning to make sense; pieces are falling into place in my mind. I remove the contents of the plastic bag and hold them in front of Cosine. My hands are shaking.

<br><br>“Cosine... did you do this? Did you kill Cotangent?”

<br><br>He looks into my eyes with an expression of pure terror.

<br><br>Before I can react, he turns around and sprints for the front entrance. Our mother sprints in front of the door and stands before him with crossed arms and a defeated expression.

<br><br>He sprints for the hallway, but his path is blocked once again by Theta the butler. Secant, Cosecant, Dr. Hipparchus, and I join in and slowly close in around him. He looks frantically in all directions for an escape, but to no avail.

<br><br>“Cosine,” I exclaim, “You are under arrest for the murder of Cotangent.”

<br><br>The pain and conflict I feel over arresting my own brother is overshadowed by my ruthless pursuit of justice.

<br><br>We fully encircle him, and I grab his wrists and fasten them in my handcuffs. Feeling defeated, he falls to the floor.

<br><br>“I can’t so I expected you to be involved whatsoever, Cosine,” I say in a haughty tone, “But it all makes sense now. Would you like to explain it to them, or shall I?”

<br><br>He stares indignantly at the floor.

<br><br>“Very well. As most of us already know, Cotangent was poisoned using 2π. Let me ask you, who would have the easiest access to copious amounts of 2π? Cosine, of course. It is his favorite food after all.”

<br><br>Gasps echo around the room. It was staring us in the face the entire time.

<br><br>“Not only did Cosine get rid of Cotangent with the poison,” I continue, “ but he also incessantly accused our own mother, Tan, during my investigation. Y, you may ask? Well, that is my favorite question. By getting rid of Cotangent the merger contract after the merger contract was signed, Tangent Enterprises would inherit complete control over both companies. Secant told me herself, she and Cosecant want nothing to do with the business world, so there would be no one to fill Cotangent’s position aside from its new business partner: Tangent Enterprises. Then, to gain control over Tangent Enterprises, he attempted to frame his own mother so she would be arrested, and he, as the heir to her position, would inherit the entire company. Diabolical.”

<br><br>“And I would have gotten away with it too,” Cosecant scoffs, “If it weren’t for you meddling functions.”

<br><br>I call the PPD (Pythagorean Police Department) and they arrived within minutes.

<br><br>“I don’t think we are going to be seeing Cosine for a long time,” I remark proudly.

<br><br>After that day, everything changed for our two families. Our shared pain over that night brought us closer together, and even Cosecant and I were able to get along. I worked alongside my mother in managing the company, taking on some of the slack that Cotangent’s absence left behind. Secant and Cosecant, their resent for the business world having subsided along with their resent for our family, aided in the company’s management. Among my greatest accomplishments of all, however, is the family I have grown. I am now a parent function! Who was once only “Sine” is now “y=Sin(x).” I have two beautiful children, opposite and hypotenuse.

<br><br>My happiness used to be like a Sine inverse graph: it was finite; it had a fixed domain; it lasted for only a period and never longer. Now, my happiness is like a Sine graph, extending infinitely across the x axis</p>
