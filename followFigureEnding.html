    <p>I ignore my nagging thoughts and descend into the darkness of the cellar. I reassure myself that this evidence could be pivotal in my search for the killer.

<br><br>Eventually I feel the stiff concrete beneath my shoes. The cellar is pitch black, spare a dim, flickering light in the corner illuminating some sort of tarp over a box.

<br><br>I approach the light with caution in each step. I wince at the slightest sound of my sole contacting the floor. I step into the light and tear the tarp away.

<br><br>Beneath it is a steel safe. I am shocked I have never come across it in all my years living in this house. I squat before it to get a better look at the key pad. Written above the buttons is a sort of trigonometry problem. I begin to read it to myself, when a familiar voice interrupts me from behind.

<br><br>“You just couldn’t mind your own business, could you Sine?”

<br><br>A gunshot rings throughout the house</p>
