    <p>I impulsively run out into the hallway and chase after the figure. I’m sure Cosecant will be able to make sure everyone in the dining hall stays safe. In the back of my mind, however, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m running towards danger.

<br><br>The hallway grows darker the further we travel. I see the figure turn a corner and I follow closely behind. I turn the corner, but the figure is nowhere to be seen. The door to the kitchen at the end of the hall swings slightly on its hinges. They must have run through there.

<br><br>The threatening thought I shouldn’t be here grows louder.

<br><br>I quietly slide through the door. The kitchen before me is dimly lit and seemingly empty. I look around for any signs of activity. On the right wall is a row of boxes of π, organized from least to greatest. At the end of the row, I notice a box is missing. The 2π... it’s all gone. The killer was here.

<br>><br>I hear a door creak open in the hallway. I rush out the kitchen door to see the figure rush through the cellar door. I run over to the door and hesitate for a moment. Before me, the cellar stairs descend into darkness. The nagging whispers telling me to turn back are now screams. I could ignore them in the pursuit of evidence, or I could return to the dining hall and interrogate Secant and Theta.</p>
