    <h1>Sine The Sleuth</h1>

    <p>“Of course,” I respond, “I’m just as worried as you. Cosine, keep watch while I’m gone.”

<br><br>I run down the hall towards the bathroom, its warm light peeking out from underneath the door.

<br><br>“Cosecant,” I bang on the door, “are you in there?”

<br><br>Silence.

<br><br>“Cosecant!” I shout again. My mind races: What if he slipped out the window? What if he is guilty and I let him get away? I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself...

<br><br>“Cosecant! I’m coming in!” I drive my shoulder against the door and it thrusts open.

<br><br>“Cosecant!” I yell with concern. His body is shivering and curled into a heap on the floor. I run to his side and grab his shoulders.

<br><br>“Of course it’s you,” he says with a shaky, defeated whisper. “Is my father okay?”

<br><br>“Cosecant, are you okay?”

<br><br>“Tell me if me if he’s okay, Sine.”

<br><br>“I’m so sorry...”

<br><br>“I knew it,” he sobs. “It must have been 2π”

<br><br>“How did you know he wasn’t okay...” I ask with a suspicious tone, “And what do you mean ‘2π’?”

<br><br>“Must I explain everything to you?” Even in his dire state he still finds the energy for sass. “I’ve only ever felt this way after eating 2π. To my father and I, it’s practically a poison. It makes us... undefined.”

<br><br>Undefined. It makes so much sense. I hadn’t even considered the prospect. Being undefined is something my brother and I have never had to worry about. It’s impossible for a Cosine or Sine function to be undefined, after all.

<br><br>“I see,” I say, gasping at the revelation. “Someone must have put 2π in Cotangent’s food. But how did you get exposed to it... unless you were the one handling the poison?”

<br><br>“How dare you suggest such a thing,” he replies indignantly. “With the quality of your hospitality, I’m not surprised you didn’t notice that your butler switched my and my father’s plates. I only had a small bite before I noticed it wasn’t mine and switched with my father. I suppose he had the rest. If you are going to point fingers, start with that nasty butler of yo-”

<br><br>He is overcome by a fit of coughs and wheezes.

<br><br>“You need medical attention,” I say.

<br><br>I make a call, and minutes later Dr. Hipparchus comes running into the room with a medical bag that clanks with each frantic step.

<br><br>“I’ve got this from here,” he says, pushing me away from Cosecant. As I get up to leave, I see an obscure figure run past the bathroom door. Someone is running away from the dining hall.

<br><br>I rush towards the door to pursue them but stop for a moment before crossing the threshold. A part of me thinks I should return to the dining hall to interrogate Secant and Theta the butler. And that way, I can make sure no one else has gotten hurt, or worse....</p>
