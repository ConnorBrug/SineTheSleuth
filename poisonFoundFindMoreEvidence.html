        <p>It feels almost as though I am failing mother purely by considering such an extreme idea. I know my mother, and she is not a criminal. Cosine must be in shock.

<br><br>I tell Cosine I’m going to look for more evidence. He looks defeated, but that is not what interests me now. What interests me is finding out where he came running in from.

<br><br>I jog down the hall and peak around the corner. I look to my right and see the kitchen door at the end of a corridor, nothing important. I turn my head to the left. Down the hall I see the cellar door, just barely peeking out of its frame.

<br><br>I peer around me to make sure I’m not being followed, and then slip in through the cellar door. Before me is a flight of wooden stairs travelling into the darkness of the cellar. I reassure myself this evidence could be pivotal in my investigation, and I descend into the obscurity below.

<br><br>Eventually I feel the stiff concrete beneath my shoes. The cellar is pitch black, spare a dim, flickering light in the corner illuminating some sort of tarp over a box.

<br><br>I approach the light with caution in each step. I wince at the slightest sound of my sole contacting the floor. I step into the light and tear the tarp away.

<br><br>Beneath it is a steel safe. I am shocked I have never come across it in all my years living in this house. I squat before it to get a better look at the key pad. Written above the buttons is a sort of trigonometry problem. It must unlock the safe.</p>
