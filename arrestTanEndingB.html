      <p>With a heavy heart, I approach mother in her arm chair. If arresting her is the only way to protect the others, I suppose it must be done. Yet if it is right, why must it feel so wrong?

<br><br>Today I learned that happiness is not infinite like a Sine graph, extending endlessly across the x axis. It is instead a Sine inverse graph: it is finite; it has a restricted domain; it lasts only for a period and never more.

<br><br>Today I am no longer Sine. I am henceforth Sine^-1.
