<h2>A Trigonometry</h2>
<h2>Choose Your Own</h2>
<h3>Adventure</h3>
<p>Lightning cracked above Tan Manor on a chilling Saturday afternoon. The brass door knocker rang throughout its sprawling halls. The Cotangents had arrived. The Tangents and the Cotangents have been harsh competitors in the Pi industry for generations, but they meet here tonight to discuss a sort of truce, a consolidation of assets. However, no one could have predicted that the night would soon be as negative as the third quadrant. Our hero, Sine, tells the tale of how the evening went from a merger to a murder.</p>
    <p>Directions: You are the trigonometric function, Sine. Read the following story and choose which path you would like to take when prompted.</p>
    <p>Goal: Find and arrest the murderer without losing any more innocent lives.
    <p>Good luck.</p>
