    <p>I question Sec and he says he is innnocent. 
        
        <br><br>Secant accuses Tan.
        
        <br><br>Cos pulls me off to the side and tells me that Tan is the most likely suspect because he probably wants complete control over the company, and itâ€™s no wonder he waited to kill Cot until after the documents were signed. 
        
        <br><br>Cos encourages me to arrest Tan as if he is a dangerous killer he needs to be detained.
