    <p>I rush back to the dining hall. Following a mysterious figure when there is a killer on the loose does not feel safe. When I enter the room, Secant immediately runs towards me.

<br><br>“How is he?” She asks with grief in her voice. “Is he safe?”

<br><br>“He’s safe,” I assure her, “I got to him just in time. He and your father were exposed to 2π. Luckily, Cosecant only had a small amount.”

<br><br>“I knew it!” she exclaimed, “You should have known 2π would make them undefined, how could you be so foolish?”

<br><br>“Well, let me ask you this, Secant. Earlier you seemed as though you wanted to be anywhere but here. Why the rush?”

<br><br>“Are you implying that I am somehow involved?” She scoffs. “Cotangent and Cosecant are insistent on there being no 2π remotely near them, and for good reason. I couldn’t get my hands on it if I tried. As for the rush, I dread the business world entirely, and I wanted to spare myself the anguish of sitting through another dinner with reciprocals. Cosecant agrees, we want nothing to do with the Pi Industry. If you’re looking for suspects, look first at your butler, Theta. Or better yet, your own mother!”

<br><br>I turn away Secant. Though I am not entirely convinced by her testimony, she raises some good points. I summon Theta. He comes jogging into the dining hall.

<br><br>“Sine, what can I do for you?” he inquires.

<br><br>“Theta, you have always been so loyal. All I ask is you answer my questions honestly.”

<br><br>“Of course, sir.”

<br><br>“We have reason to believe Cotangent’s food was tampered with. Furthermore, Cotangent and Cosecant, the two victims of the night, had their dishes switched upon serving. You wouldn’t happen to know anything about this?”

<br><br>Theta’s voice trembles. “My humblest apologies, sir. I found it difficult to focus when Cosine burst into the kitchen demanding we serve the food. I have never seen him in such a rush. I may have swapped a few plates around in the franticness of the moment.”

<br><br>“Thank you for your honesty, Theta,” I respond. “Speaking of Cosine, did you see where he went?”

<br><br>In my eagerness to question the suspects, I hadn’t noticed that Cosine was not in the room.

<br><br>As if on cue, he appears from the hallway, walking hastily in my direction.

<br><br>“Brother, there you are! I was looking all over for you,” he says with a slight pant. “I’ve had a thought, but you must assure me that you will remain calm.”

<br><br>“Of course, Cosine, you can tell me anything,” I say, worried of what he has to say.

<br><br>“It pains me immensely to say, but I have reason to believe,” he lowers his voice to a whisper, “that our own mother may be responsible for the death of Cotangent.”

<br><br>“How could you say such a thing, Cosine?” I exclaim, “Mother would never go to such extremes...”

<br><br>“I thought so too,” he continues, “but her motives seem strong. She and Cotangent were arguing all night, it seemed as though a business partnership would never work. By removing Cotangent from the equation- conveniently after the documents were signed, might I add- she would inherent complete control over both companies. Not only would she double her assets, she would be the sole proprietor of the Pi Industry.”

<br><br>“It just can’t be...” I say, attempting to grapple with what I’m hearing.

<br><br><br><br>“If it was not her, she could be an accomplice. It would be an easy feat for someone of her wealth and status. For the safety of all functions present, I think her arrest may be the only option. I know I may sound a bit obtuse, but I assure you it’s true.”

<br><br>I sit in silence for a moment, then glance over at mother. She is seated in an armchair staring blankly out the window. Could this function I have known my whole life be capable of such things? And could I, her son and numerator, arrest her so cold heartedly? It could be beneficial to wait until I find more evidence.

<br><br>Cosine does have a convincing argument, however. She has much to gain from Cotangent’s death, and if she is responsible, she must be detained immediately. This case is highly time sensitive, who knows what else she is capable of..</p>
